Please hand in: Speculate why these documents have high PageRank values, i.e., why is it that these particular pages are linked to by (possibly) many other pages with (possibly) high PageRank values. Are all of these documents ones that users would likely want to see in response to an appropriate query? Give some examples of ones that are and ones that are not. For those that are not "interesting" documents, why might they have high PageRank values? How do the pages with high PageRank compare to the pages with many in-links? In short, give an analysis of the PageRank results you obtain.
